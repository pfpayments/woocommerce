<p>The Payment Process of PostFinance Checkout is <strong>completely standardized</strong> for <strong>every payment method</strong>. This gives you the ability to simply add
a payment method or processor without changes inside of your WooCommerce configuration. An overview about the states and the payment processes of PostFinance Checkout
can be found in the <a href="https://checkout.postfinance.ch/en-us/doc/payment/transaction-process" target="_blank">Payment Documentation</a>.</p>

<ol class="glossary">
<li>
<p>When the user is redirected to PostFinance Checkout to process the payment the order within WooCommerce is marked as <code>Redirected</code>. Along this the transaction within PostFinance Checkout is created resp. updated with the latest address, line items etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the transaction is marked as <code>authorized</code> in PostFinance Checkout the order within WooCommerce will be marked as <code>On hold</code>. The amount is only reserved at this point. The order is not yet ready to be fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the transaction fails during the authorization process the WooCommerce order is marked as <code>Failed</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case the delivery indication is <code>pending</code>, the order within WooCommerce will move into either <code>Waiting</code> or <code>Manual Decision</code>. <code>Waiting</code> means that the transaction is completed but the delivery indication is not yet decided. E.g. the money still needs to be cleared by the customer bank. The status will automatically update later on. <code>Manual Decision</code> means that in this case you have to review and decide the outcome of the delivery indication manually. See more details in <a href="#_on_hold_orders">On hold orders</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case the decision about the fulfillment is negative, the order within WooCommerce will be marked as <code>canceled</code> which means you should not be fulfilled the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you decide to void an authorized transaction (in case for example the products ordered are no longer in stock), the order within WooCommerce will also be marked as <code>canceled</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the transaction is marked in PostFinance Checkout as <code>fulfill</code> the order within WooCommerce will be be marked as <code>Processing</code> (for physical goods) or <code>Completed</code> (for virtual/downloadable products). This is when you can start the fulfillment process. Once this state has been reached the plugin does not change the status of the order anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Deferred payment completion</strong></p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Retailers often have the case that they want to authorize transactions only and start the fulfillment process once all items are shippable. This is also possible with PostFinance Checkout.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>However, certain processes should be followed. If you have configured payment completion to be deferred you should capture the transaction before you initiate the shipment
as it can always happen that a completion fails. If you want to be sure that you do not ship items for which you have not been paid you should postpone the shipment until
the fulfill state is reached. Initially the transaction will be in the <code>Authorized</code> state in PostFinance Checkout and <code>On hold</code> in WooCommerce. If you want to start the fulfillment process make sure you initiate the completion process as described above. Once the completion was successful the order will switch into the <code>Fulfill</code> state in PostFinance Checkout and into <code>Processing</code> state in WooCommerce.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now start the fulfillment process and switch the order into the <code>Processing</code> state in WooCommerce.</p>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<p>For a streamlined deferred completion process in your shop, we recommend the following steps:</p>
</div><div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Filter all  orders and select <code>On hold</code> orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capture all <code>onHold</code> orders. Once the completion has successfully finished the order will automatically switch into the <code>Processing</code> or <code>Completed</code> state depending on the type of products (digital, physical).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now start to fulfill all orders in the <code>Processing</code> state.</p>
